# Alohomora
ALOHOMORA is a vision-based blind stick. It aims at providing the visually impaired people with an easyand handy object identification and navigation system. The model that we will be using for objectidentification has been trained on the images of famous objects/obstacles that can be encountered by a visually impaired person in everyday life. This information will act as the basis for the results given to the user. Also, the distance to the object/obstacle will be calculated using a sensor and accordingly theinformation will be used to inform the person about the range or distance at which the object is.Furthermore, the system needs a continuous power supply to for its operation. The program on themini-computer should always be running in order to provide satisfying results to the visually impaired person.
